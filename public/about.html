            <p class="text-gray-500 leading-relaxed text-xl">I&rsquo;ve always loved my independence and never had trouble with the &ldquo;What do you want to do when you grow up?&rdquo; thing. 
      
      Started my career as a professor in Engineering college, I strongly felt I had to do something with my learnings before acquiring more of it.
      
      I love helping people, building and nurturing relationships, and facilitating inspiring conversations.
      I believe in the statement "If you learn, TEACH and if you get, GIVE.
      
      When I was asked to do a Post graduation to retain my job, I quit and transitioned into the role of an entrepreneur.
      
      Obviously, education has changed since then, but I love the way it's transformed. 
      
      I love the fact that online is more 'in' thing now, as it gives us the flexibility to work from the comfort of our locations( I'm NOT a big Work From Home fan). Staying in a small town has its pluses, Oh so many!
      
      I got an opportunity to start up from "my small town" and ever since have been creating jobs and giving back in many ways than one. 
      
      Oh, the culture I'm building in my office, I would like to write on that one soon.
      
      Since the last four and a half years, we have been doing email marketing for a few ed-tech clients in India. 
      
      Also been passionately developing websites for entrepreneurs. Oh, I love working with entrepreneurs, helping them put out their offering in best possible way. It is so inspiring and empowering.
      
      I've also got an almost unhealthy obsession with everything around the Google community for developers, the (Google Developer Groups) GDG and (Women TechMakers)WTM. I'm the proud organiser of GDG/WTM Vizag and organising impactful technical and non-technical events for my community inspires me beyond words. Being the face of my community is more fun than ever.
      
      Plus, I just love narrating books.
      
      And UX. 
      
      Okay, design, too&mdash;but don't ask me to draw something you'll recognize. I just have a decent feel for knowing what works.
      
      So if you&rsquo;re looking for someone who can think up big ideas (and small ones), write a little copy for different audiences and collaborate with your teams, then we might make a good match.
